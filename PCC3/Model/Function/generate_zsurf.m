% purpose: to find the relationship between two angles and z coordinate of 
% end effector
%
% Input: 
%   beta_x0 | type:(m,n): the range of beta_x produced by meshgrid, it should includes 0
%   beta_y0 | type:(n,m): the range of beta_y produced by meshgrid, it should includes 0
%   ldt    | type:double: base_top_point+disk_top_center_to_plane_distance 
% Output:
%   end_z | type:(1,n): the z of beta_x and beta_y

end
