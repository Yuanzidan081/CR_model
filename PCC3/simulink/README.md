+ cylinder_joint_simple_asm_o: original simulink file
+ cylinder_joint_simple_asm_1: improved simulink file, you can run it as the demo1.gif shows.
+ cylinder_joint_simple_3_pairs_asm_urdf1:it use three pairs of joints, and it was exported by the format of urdf file first.

reference for the combination  of the pulley and cable, see the following shown in the documentation

the example 
"sm_cable_tower_crane"
"sm_cable_drive_right_angle"
"sm_cable_space_manipulator"

the blocks 
"Belt-Cable Properties"

now I am trying to use cylinder_joint_3_pairs_asm_SLDASM to make a simple demo of cable driven robot
