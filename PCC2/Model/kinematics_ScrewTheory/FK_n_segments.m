% Purpose: compute the kinematic model of n-segments continuum robot with
% the given parameters kappa, tau and alpha

%% Input: 
%   kappa: all the arc curvature, you'd better set it as a n*1 vector
%   tau: all the arc torsion, you can set it as zero, you'd better set it
%        as a n*1 vector 
%   alpha: the angle between the bending plane and the local +X axis, you
%          must set it as a n*1 vector
%   number_arc_interval: the number of the interval in every arc, the first arc has k(1)+1，
%           the second has k(2), ... the whole continuum robot has sum(k)+1, you
%          must set it as a n*1 vector 
%   number_segments: the number of continuum robot segments, it is a scalar
%   disk_interval: the distance interval between the discs of continuum robot,
%            it is a scalar

%% Output:
%   H: the homogenous matrix of each center of discs, set by the form of
%      n*16 vector, the i th row means the i th homogenous matrix.
%   R: the rotation matrix of each center of discs, set by the form of
%      n*9 vector, the i th row means the i th rotation matrix.
%   p: the position vector of each center of discs, set by the form of n*3，
%      the i th row mean the i th position vector.

    error("the legnth of kappa should be equal to the number of arc!");

if length(tau)==1

elseif length(tau)~=number_segments
    error("the legnth of tau should be equal to the number of arc!");
end

% check if alpha is valid

if length(alpha)~=number_segments
    error("the legnth of alpha should be equal to the number of arc!");
end

% check if length_arc is valid
if length(number_arc_interval)~=number_segments
